    "# No-Execution Code Evaluation for Belief Tracking Circuit Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a static code evaluation of the implementation in `/net/scratch2/smallyan/belief_tracking_eval`.\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md, this project investigates how language models internally represent and track beliefs of characters using causal mediation and abstraction methods. The main experiments include:\n",
    "- Localizing Answer Payload and Pointer\n",
    "- Localizing Binding Address, Payload, and Source Reference\n",
    "- Localizing Visibility Source Reference, Payload, and Address+Pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Each code block is evaluated on four binary criteria:\n",
    "1. **Runnable (Y/N)**: Syntactically valid with required imports/definitions available\n",
    "2. **Correct-Implementation (Y/N)**: Logic correctly implements the described computation\n",
    "3. **Redundant (Y/N)**: Block duplicates another block's computation\n",
    "4. **Irrelevant (Y/N)**: Block doesn't contribute to the project goal"
