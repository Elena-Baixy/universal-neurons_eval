    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "PASS",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "The replicated documentation reports universal neuron percentages that exactly match the original: GPT2-medium (1.23%), Pythia-160M (1.26%), GPT2-small (4.16%). Statistical signatures (high skew, high kurtosis, negative input bias, larger weight norms) are also consistent. All metrics are within the 5% tolerance threshold (0% deviation).",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "All conclusions in the replicated documentation are consistent with the original: monosemantic signature (high skew/kurtosis), weight properties (large norm, negative bias), layer specialization (depth-dependent patterns), and prediction/suppression neuron patterns in later layers. No conclusions are omitted or contradicted.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external or hallucinated information was introduced. All claims are either directly from the original documentation (plan.md, CodeWalkthrough.md), derived from analysis of pre-computed data, or reasonable methodological limitation statements. No invented findings or external references are present."
