  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "Replicated documentation reports universal neuron percentages that exactly match the original: pythia-160m (1.26%), stanford-gpt2-small-a (4.16%), stanford-gpt2-medium-a (1.23%). All five statistical properties (lower sparsity, high skew, high kurtosis, negative input bias, large L2 penalty) were verified and match the original claims. Zero deviation from expected values, well within the 5% tolerance threshold.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents conclusions fully consistent with the original plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. Key claims about monosemantic signatures, statistical properties of universal neurons, and layer depth specialization are all supported. The replication confirms the original hypothesis that universal neurons exhibit distinctive statistical properties distinguishing them from non-universal neurons.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external or hallucinated information was introduced. All model names, percentages, and statistical properties are traceable to original repository files (dataframes/neuron_dfs/*.csv, plan.md, CodeWalkthrough.md). Limitations are honestly disclosed (full correlation computation was not re-run). No invented neuron families or external references appear in the replicated documentation."
