  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "All reported results match the original documentation within tolerance. Key metrics show 0% deviation: GPT2-small universality (4.16% replicated vs 4.16% original), GPT2-medium (1.23% vs 1.23%), Pythia-160M (1.26% vs 1.26%). All 8 statistical properties of universal neurons (high skewness/kurtosis, large negative bias, high weight norm, low activation frequency) are validated with percentile values matching the original claims. The replication properly documents experiments that were not replicated (causal interventions) as limitations rather than contradictory results.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents conclusions fully consistent with the original thesis that universal neurons are more likely to be monosemantic and interpretable. All key insights are validated: universal neurons are rare (1-5%), have distinctive monosemantic signatures, exhibit sparse activation patterns, and can be taxonomized into interpretable families. Limitations are properly acknowledged without contradicting original conclusions.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external or hallucinated information was introduced. The replication uses only metrics and methods from the original documentation, cites pre-computed data from the repository, properly attributes findings to the original paper, clearly distinguishes between directly replicated results and methodology demonstrations, and accurately describes the replication environment. The broader implications discussed are reasonable extensions based on validated findings, not hallucinations."
