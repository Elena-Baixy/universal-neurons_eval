    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",

    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "NA"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment can be fully reconstructed from the plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md documentation. The plan provides clear methodology for computing excess correlation, specific thresholds (>0.5) for universal neuron classification, and expected results (1.23%, 1.26%, 4.16%) for validation. No significant guesswork was required.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "The environment was successfully set up using the provided requirements.txt. Key dependencies (transformer-lens, torch, pandas) were available and compatible. Pre-computed data loaded without issues, and model weights were accessible from HuggingFace. No unresolved version conflicts.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Replicated results are fully deterministic and stable. Universal neuron counts match exactly across runs (1.23%, 1.26%, 4.16%). Statistical properties are consistent with original data. Analysis uses pre-computed statistics rather than stochastic processes.",
    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "This is not a demo-only repository. It provides full experimental code and pre-computed data for complete replication. The replication was performed using the full neuron statistics data, not a demo subset. Paper notebooks exist but are supplementary."
