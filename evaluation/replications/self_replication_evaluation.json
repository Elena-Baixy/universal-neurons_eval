  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "FAIL",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The plan.md clearly documents all hypotheses, metrics (excess correlation > 0.5), and expected results. CodeWalkthrough.md explains file organization. Pre-computed dataframes and paper notebooks provide complete reference implementations for all analyses.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "Requirements.txt lacks pinned versions. Model downloads failed due to disk quota on shared HuggingFace cache. Dataset paths use undefined environment variables. Tokenized datasets for correlation computation are not included in the repository.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Pre-computed dataframes yield deterministic results. Streaming Pearson correlation algorithm is mathematically deterministic. Replicated percentages exactly match paper (1.26%, 4.16%, 1.23%). No randomness in analysis pipeline."
