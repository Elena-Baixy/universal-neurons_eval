  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS",
    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "NA"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment can be fully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. The plan explicitly specifies hypotheses, methodology (Pearson correlation with 0.5 excess correlation threshold), expected results (exact percentages: 1.26%, 4.16%, 1.23%), and data sources. No major guesswork was required.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "The environment was successfully reproduced. requirements.txt lists all dependencies (torch, transformer-lens, pandas, numpy). All packages installed without conflicts. Pre-computed dataframes loaded correctly. Model loading via transformer_lens worked. CUDA GPU was available and utilized.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Results are deterministic and stable. Universal neuron percentages matched exactly across verification runs (1.26%, 4.16%, 1.23%). Statistical property comparisons yielded consistent results. Pre-computed correlation data ensures reproducibility.",
    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "Not applicable. This repository provides full implementation code (correlations_fast.py, analysis/), pre-computed data, paper notebooks, and SLURM scripts. It is not demo-only and supports both verification and full replication."
