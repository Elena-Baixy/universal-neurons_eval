    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "All replicated results match the original documentation exactly. Universal neuron percentages are identical (Pythia-160M: 1.26%, GPT2-small: 4.16%, GPT2-medium: 1.23%). All five statistical property verifications (lower activation frequency, high skew, high kurtosis, negative input bias, large weight norm) passed across all three models.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated conclusions are consistent with the original. Both confirm 1-5% universal neurons, distinctive statistical signatures (monosemantic properties), and depth specialization patterns. The replication appropriately acknowledges scope limitations without contradicting original claims.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "All information in the replicated documentation derives from the original repository (dataframes/neuron_dfs/, plan.md, CodeWalkthrough.md). No external references, invented findings, or hallucinated details were introduced. The paper citation matches the original."
