  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "Universal neuron percentages match exactly between original (plan.md) and replication: GPT2-medium 1.23%, Pythia-160M 1.26%, GPT2-small 4.16%. Statistical signatures (high skew, high kurtosis, large negative input bias, larger weight norms) are consistent with the original claims. All replicated results are within acceptable tolerance and match the expected values from the original documentation.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents conclusions consistent with the original: (1) monosemantic signature of universal neurons (high skew, kurtosis, sparse activation), (2) weight properties (larger weight norms, negative input bias), (3) layer specialization, and (4) prediction/suppression patterns in later layers. The replication appropriately acknowledges limitations, including not replicating causal intervention experiments.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "All claims in the replicated documentation can be traced to the original repository: plan.md (methodology, expected results), CodeWalkthrough.md (code structure, paper reference), and repository data files (pre-computed neuron statistics). No hallucinated findings, external references, or invented details were introduced."
