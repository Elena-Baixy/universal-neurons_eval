  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "The replicated documentation reports results that match the original:\n(1) Universal neuron prevalence of 4.16% for GPT2-small is an exact match.\n(2) All 8 statistical properties (skewness, kurtosis, input bias, L2 penalty, \nactivation frequency, W_U kurtosis, cos similarity, activation mean) show \nthe correct directional differences between universal and non-universal neurons.\n(3) The replication honestly acknowledges its demo scope and does not claim to \nhave replicated experiments it did not perform (causal interventions, full taxonomy).\n(4) The methodology description is accurate and consistent with the original codebase.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents conclusions fully consistent with the original:\n(1) The main thesis about universal neurons being more monosemantic and interpretable is affirmed.\n(2) All three original hypotheses are addressed: universality-monosemanticity correlation (H1), \ntaxonomization possibility (H2), and distinctive statistical properties (H3).\n(3) The key findings about 1-5% universality rate, monosemantic signatures (high skew/kurtosis), \nweight properties (large negative bias, large weight norm), and sparse activation are all confirmed.\n(4) No conclusions contradict the original - claims about non-replicated experiments \n(causal interventions) are appropriately qualified as \"Not Attempted\" rather than making claims.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "The replicated documentation introduces no external or hallucinated information:\n(1) All numerical results (4.16% universality, statistical percentiles) are derived from the \noriginal repository's pre-computed data or correct calculations.\n(2) No external references or citations to papers/sources not in the original are introduced.\n(3) Implementation details (TransformerLens, A100 hardware) are clearly marked as replication-specific.\n(4) The \"Broader Implications\" section provides reasonable interpretations clearly labeled as \nsuch, not presented as original findings.\n(5) Example neuron analysis (L0.N2436) is derived from actual replication experiments, not fabricated.\n(6) No fabricated findings or invented details detected."
