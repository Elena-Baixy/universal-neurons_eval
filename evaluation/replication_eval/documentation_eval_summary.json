  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "All key numerical results match exactly between original and replicated documentation. Universal neuron prevalence percentages (1.23%, 1.26%, 4.16%) are identical. Statistical properties of universal neurons (large weight norm, negative input bias, high skew/kurtosis, lower activation frequency) are confirmed. Prediction neuron layer distribution patterns match the original findings.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated conclusions are fully consistent with the original hypotheses. The claim that 1-5% of neurons are universal supports the original hypothesis about monosemanticity. The confirmation of distinctive statistical signatures directly validates the original hypothesis about weight/activation properties. The prediction neuron analysis extends the original finding with quantitative ratios that are consistent with the original claim.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external references, URLs, or citations beyond the original Gurnee et al. (2024) paper were introduced. The specific quantitative ratios (250x, 21x, 27x) for prediction neuron distribution are derived from legitimate replication analysis of pre-computed dataframes, not hallucinated. No contradictory or unsupported claims were found in the replicated documentation."
