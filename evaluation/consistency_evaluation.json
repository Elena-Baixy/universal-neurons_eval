    "Checklist": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "PASS",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "PASS"
    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the plan match the recorded results in the implementation notebooks: (1) Universal neuron percentages match exactly - GPT2-medium 1.23%, Pythia-160M 1.26%, GPT2-small 4.16% as claimed in plan and verified in family_count.ipynb/neuron dataframes; (2) Statistical properties of universal neurons match - they have more negative input bias (-0.486 vs -0.248), higher activation skew (1.100 vs 0.024), and higher kurtosis (8.111 vs 3.735) as shown in properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb; (3) Prediction neuron layer distribution matches - high vocab_kurt neurons are concentrated in later layers (17-23) with 1136 neurons after midpoint vs 125 before, confirming the plan claim that prediction neurons become prevalent after network midpoint.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "A plan.md file exists and all 6 methodology steps from the plan are fully implemented: (1) Pearson correlations implemented in correlations_fast.py, correlations_parallel.py, correlations.py; (2) Statistical property analysis in summary.py, weights.py, and properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb; (3) Automated tests using vocab/NLP labels in explain.py and analysis/heuristic_explanation.py; (4) Weight analysis/logit attribution in prediction_neurons.ipynb and analysis/prediction_neurons.py; (5) Entropy neuron interventions in entropy_intervention.py and entropy_neurons.ipynb; (6) Path ablation for attention deactivation in attention_deactivation.py and bos_signal_neurons.ipynb."
