    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All numerical claims in the documentation match the implementation results exactly. Universal neuron percentages (GPT2-medium: 1.23%, Pythia-160m: 1.26%, GPT2-small: 4.16%) are identical. Statistical properties of universal neurons (larger weight norm, more negative input bias, higher skew ~0.7-0.9 vs ~0-0.2, higher kurtosis ~6 vs ~3, lower activation frequency) are all confirmed by the data.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All 5 methodology steps from the plan are implemented: (1) correlation computation via correlations.py and variants, (2) statistical properties in properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb, (3) automated neuron classification in family-specific notebooks, (4) logit attribution in prediction_neurons.ipynb, (5) causal interventions in entropy_neurons.ipynb and bos_signal_neurons.ipynb. All 6 planned experiments are reflected in the implementation with 19/19 required files present.",
        "CS3_Effect_Size": "Effect sizes are clearly non-trivial and substantial. Correlation analysis shows Cohen's d-like values of 3.96-4.74 (extremely large). Statistical properties show medium to large effect sizes (skew: d=1.25-1.92, kurtosis: d=0.52-0.83, activation sparsity: d=-0.59 to -1.20). Causal intervention effects show 20-25% changes in layer norm scale and entropy. BOS attention path ablation shows near-perfect correlations (\u03c1\u22480.94-0.97).",
        "CS4_Justification": "All key design choices are explicitly justified: (1) excess correlation threshold of 0.5 is acknowledged as reasonable filter with baseline comparison, (2) Pearson correlation is justified as standard measure computed over 100M tokens, (3) neuron family classification uses variance reduction metric with automated tests, (4) logit attribution cites prior work and uses moment statistics, (5) entropy neuron selection based on weight decay hypothesis and lowest variance criterion, (6) BOS attention mechanism uses explicit heuristic score formula. All intermediate conclusions are supported by strong evidence (correlations > 0.8, consistent patterns across models).",
        "CS5_Statistical_Significance": "While formal statistical tests (p-values, confidence intervals) are not explicitly reported, the paper provides adequate uncertainty measures: boxenplots with percentile distributions (5%, 10%, 50%, 90%, 95%), standard deviation bands on position neurons, ranges across 5 model seeds, correlation coefficients with scatter plots, and random baseline comparisons. Results are replicated across 5 GPT2 seeds and 3 model architectures with large sample sizes (100M tokens). Effect sizes are large enough to be clearly distinguishable from noise."
