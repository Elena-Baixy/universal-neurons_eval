    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results recorded in the implementation. Universal neuron percentages (GPT2-medium: 1.23%, GPT2-small: 4.16%, Pythia-160M: 1.26%) exactly match the universal.csv files. Statistical properties (large negative bias, high skew, high kurtosis for universal neurons) are confirmed in the neuron_dfs data. Alphabet neurons (18/26 letters) match the 18-axes figure output. Prediction neuron patterns across layers are consistently demonstrated.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All methodology steps from the plan are reflected in the implementation: (1) Pearson correlation computation via correlations_fast.py with StreamingPearsonComputer, (2) Statistical properties analysis via summary.py, weights.py, and properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb, (3) Automated taxonomization via explain.py using variance reduction with vocab/NLP features, (4) Weight analysis via prediction_neurons.ipynb performing WU*wout analysis, (5) Causal interventions via intervention.py, entropy_intervention.py, and attention_deactivation.py with corresponding analysis notebooks.",
        "CS3_Effect_Size": "Effect sizes are clearly non-trivial and substantial. For universal vs non-universal neurons: excess correlation difference is 0.48 (0.587 vs 0.105), input bias Cohen's d = -0.99 (large), skew Cohen's d = 1.33 (large), kurtosis Cohen's d = 0.64 (medium), weight norm Cohen's d = 0.67 (medium). Variance reduction for syntax neurons achieves 50-63%, which is substantial. Causal intervention effects show clear, measurable changes in entropy and attention patterns.",
        "CS4_Justification": "All key design choices are explicitly justified: (1) Universal neuron threshold (0.5) creates clear separation with only 1-5% qualifying and predicts interpretability, (2) Variance reduction method is justified as high reduction indicates strong feature response, (3) Prediction neuron identification via kurtosis/skew is justified as concentrated effects produce high kurtosis, (4) Causal intervention is justified as testing causal role through fixed activations, (5) BOS attention heuristic is validated by path ablation results. Each conclusion follows from presented evidence with >35% variance reduction thresholds.",
        "CS5_Statistical_Significance": "Key experimental results do NOT report appropriate measures of uncertainty or significance. While scipy.stats is imported, it is only used for descriptive statistics (skew, kurtosis, percentileofscore) rather than inferential tests. The implementation lacks: formal statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA), p-values for key claims, confidence intervals, and error bars with clear explanation. Percentile bands across seeds provide some variability measure but are not formal statistical significance measures. Results rely on visual demonstration and replication across seeds rather than formal statistical testing."
