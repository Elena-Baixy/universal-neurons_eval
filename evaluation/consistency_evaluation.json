    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results in the implementation. Verified: (1) Universal neuron percentages exactly match (GPT2-medium 1.23%, Pythia-160M 1.26%, GPT2-small 4.16%), (2) Statistical properties of universal neurons confirmed (large weight norm, negative input bias, high skew/kurtosis, lower activation frequency), (3) Entropy neuron L23.945 has high weight norm (100th percentile) and low logit variance (0th percentile) as claimed.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All plan steps appear in the implementation. Verified: (1) Correlation analysis via correlations_fast.py with dataframes for all models, (2) Statistical properties analysis in properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb, (3) Automated tests in explain.py with all 6 neuron family notebooks, (4) Logit attribution in prediction_neurons.ipynb with weights.py, (5) Causal interventions in intervention.py/entropy_intervention.py/entropy_neurons.ipynb, (6) Attention deactivation in attention_deactivation.py/bos_signal_neurons.ipynb."
