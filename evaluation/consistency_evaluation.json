    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results recorded in the implementation. Universal neuron percentages match exactly (GPT2-medium: 1.23%, GPT2-small: 4.16%, Pythia-160m: 1.26%). All statistical claims about universal neurons (large weight norm, large negative input bias, high pre-activation skew and kurtosis, lower activation frequency) are verified by comparing universal vs non-universal neurons in the dataframes. Entropy neurons L23.945 and L22.2882 are correctly identified in notebooks.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All plan steps appear in the implementation. The plan specifies 5 methodology steps and 6 experiments, all of which have corresponding Python scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks. Specifically: (1) correlations_fast.py implements pairwise Pearson correlations; (2) summary.py and weights.py implement statistical analysis; (3) explain.py implements automated neuron classification tests; (4) weights.py and prediction_neurons.ipynb implement logit attribution analysis; (5) intervention.py and entropy_intervention.py implement causal interventions; (6) attention_deactivation.py implements path ablation for attention head deactivation neurons."
