    "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results from the implementation. Key findings verified: (1) Correlation percentages (1.23%, 1.26%, 4.16%) exactly match dataframe computations, (2) Alphabet neurons (18 of 26 letters) confirmed via notebook outputs, (3) Entropy neurons L23.945 and L22.2882 identified and cosine similarity of -0.886 verified by loading model weights, (4) All major experimental results are consistent with documented conclusions. While some specific calculations (e.g., cosine similarity) are not explicitly shown in notebook cells, they can be verified from the underlying data and model weights, and all values match the documentation.",
    "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All methodology steps from the plan have corresponding implementations. Step 1 (Pearson correlations): correlations.py and variants exist. Step 2 (Statistical properties): properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb and supporting code present. Step 3 (Taxonomization): All 6 neuron family types (unigram, alphabet, previous token, position, syntax, semantic) have dedicated notebooks. Step 4 (Weight analysis): prediction_neurons.ipynb and weights.py implement this. Step 5 (Causal interventions): Both entropy and attention interventions implemented in notebooks and Python scripts. No plan steps are missing from the implementation."
