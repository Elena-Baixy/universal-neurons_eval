    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results originally recorded in the implementation. Key findings verified: (1) Universal neuron percentages match exactly - GPT2-medium 1.23%, GPT2-small 4.16%, Pythia-160m 1.26%; (2) Universal neuron properties (higher skew, kurtosis, L2 penalty, lower activation frequency) confirmed in data; (3) Depth specialization pattern confirmed; (4) Prediction neuron concentration in late layers (82.3% in layers 18-23) matches documentation; (5) Non-universal neurons show near-Gaussian distribution (skew~0, kurtosis~3.7). No contradictions found.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All steps from the final plan are reflected in the implementation: (1) Neuron correlation analysis - implemented in correlations.py/correlations_fast.py/correlations_parallel.py with results in properties_of_universal_neurons.ipynb; (2) Statistical properties analysis - implemented in summary.py/weights.py; (3) Automated taxonomization - implemented in explain.py with multiple family notebooks (unigram, alphabet, position, syntax, topic); (4) Prediction neuron analysis via logit attribution - implemented in weights.py and analysis/prediction_neurons.py; (5) Entropy neuron intervention - implemented in entropy_intervention.py with results in entropy_neurons.ipynb; (6) Attention deactivation - implemented in attention_deactivation.py with results in bos_signal_neurons.ipynb. No missing or altered steps detected.",
        "CS3_Effect_Size": "All reported effects have clearly non-trivial magnitude: (1) Universal neuron properties show large Cohen's d values - skew d=1.74, kurtosis d=0.76, sparsity d=-0.80, L2 penalty d=0.46; (2) Universal neurons show 3.0x baseline correlation, threshold at 3.71 std above mean; (3) Prediction neurons have 7.0x higher vocab kurtosis and 82.3% concentration in late layers; (4) Entropy neuron L23.945 is at 100th percentile for L2 penalty, produces 30%+ entropy change, has -0.886 cosine similarity with antipodal neuron; (5) BOS attention mechanism shows 19.4x ratio for output norm. No marginal or negligible effects reported.",
        "CS4_Justification": "All key design choices and intermediate conclusions are explicitly justified: (1) Neuron selection threshold (0.5) is acknowledged as practical rather than principled but grounded by random baseline comparison; (2) Pearson correlation method justified by capturing 'consistent activation on same inputs' with baseline validation; (3) Variance reduction metric for neuron families has clear mathematical formulation; (4) Prediction neuron identification via kurtosis>10 justified by statistical reasoning about heavy tails; (5) Entropy neuron hypothesis derived from weight decay reasoning with causal intervention validation; (6) Attention deactivation heuristic derived mathematically from attention mechanism with path ablation validation. All conclusions supported by evidence with large effect sizes.",
        "CS5_Statistical_Significance": "Key experimental results report appropriate measures of uncertainty: (1) Variability visualization through boxenplots, percentile bands, and shaded regions for cross-seed range; (2) Baseline comparisons including random rotation baseline for correlation, random Gaussian baseline for heuristics, and random neuron comparison (n=20) for interventions; (3) Strong cross-model replication across 5 GPT2-medium seeds, GPT2-small, Pythia-160M, and 5 Pythia model sizes (410M-6.9B); (4) Effect magnitude reporting with large ratios (19.4x, 7.0x, 3.0x) and correlation coefficients. While formal p-values are not reported, the multi-seed/multi-model replication and large effect sizes provide strong significance evidence appropriate for mechanistic interpretability research."
