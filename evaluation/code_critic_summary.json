  "Rationale": {
    "C1_All_Runnable": "All 28 code blocks executed successfully without errors. Functions from utils.py, analysis/correlations.py, analysis/heuristic_explanation.py, correlations_fast.py, weights.py, activations.py, summary.py, intervention.py, entropy_intervention.py, analysis/activations.py, and analysis/vocab_df.py were tested and all passed.",
    "C2_All_Correct": "All implementations correctly follow the described computations in the plan and codewalk. Functions for correlation analysis, weight statistics, activation processing, intervention hooks, and vocabulary feature extraction all produce expected outputs.",
    "C3_No_Redundant": "No code blocks were found to duplicate other blocks' computations. Each function serves a distinct purpose in the analysis pipeline.",
    "C4_No_Irrelevant": "All evaluated code blocks contribute to achieving the project goal of studying universal neurons across GPT2 language models as defined in the plan."
