  },
  "Rationale": {
    "GT1_ModelGeneralization": "The prediction neuron finding (high vocab kurtosis after network midpoint, negative skew in final layers) successfully generalizes to GPT2-XL, a model not used in the original work. Tested: layers 0-23 show mean kurtosis 3.036, layers 24-47 show mean kurtosis 3.510 (+0.474 increase). Final layers (44-47) show negative mean skew (-0.029) while earlier layers show positive skew (+0.044).",
    "GT2_DataGeneralization": "The universal neuron activation properties (elevated kurtosis indicating sparse, monosemantic patterns) hold on new data not from the Pile. Tested 5 high-correlation universal neurons on 5 diverse text samples (scientific, legal, technical, news, creative). All 5 neurons showed kurtosis > 3 on new data, and 4/5 maintained consistent skew direction.",
    "GT3_MethodGeneralization": "The Pearson correlation method for identifying universal neurons generalizes to attention heads. Applied the same correlation approach to attention patterns across GPT2-small and GPT2-medium. Found high-correlation attention head pairs (max 0.991), with 78% of comparisons showing correlation > 0.5, demonstrating the method's applicability to other model components."
